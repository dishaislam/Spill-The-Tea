Committed to Rebuilding MalibuExclusive83sharesByTMZ StaffPublishedAugust 13, 2025 6:26 PM PDTGetty CompositeJosh Flaggis defending himself after getting slammed online for what critics called a tone-deaf real estate flex in the wake of Malibu's deadly wildfires.On Tuesday, the real estate power broker posted a photo of two beachfront homes reduced to rubble in the 2025 Palisades fires captioned \"JUST SOLD!\" and noting one sold for $5 million, the other for $4.65 million. The post quickly drew hundreds of comments accusing him of insensitivity toward victims.The comments section lit up fast, with critics calling the post \"in very poor taste,\" \"horrific,\" and \"triggering and heartbreaking for a lot of people.\"Now, Flagg tells TMZ the image never should've gone up. \"I'm not going to sit back while people question my character,\" he tells us. \"The photo used in my recent post was a mistake. My marketing team posted it without my review or approval ... I was on a transatlantic flight when it went up. I'm sorry if it offended anyone.\"Waiting for your permission to load TikTok Post.Flagg, who has represented many of the beachfront sellers of the properties affected by the fires, says the criticism ignores his long history of helping Malibu recover.\"Anybody who knows me knows I worked hard to help -- placing families who lost homes, speaking out weekly on CNN andFOX, and pushing back on idiotic policies that slowed rebuilding,\" he said, adding he's fought price gouging, pushed for a fair process, and stayed vocal about recovery.\"Those sales aren't just transactions -- they're helping Malibu residents rebuild and restore neighborhoods,\" he explained. \"Showing progress is a positive sign, because it means a faster recovery and a brighter future for the community.\"Within hours of the Palisades fires igniting, Josh opened his home to everyone from casual acquaintances to close friends includingMelissa Riverswho had been displaced.Flagg closed with, \"When you’re a public figure, you’re celebrated for the good and criticized for the bad. But calling me insensitive is not accurate. Full stop.

This follows the lawsuit Ms. Stern filed against Tate in March for violent sexual assault. The tone of Mr. Tate’s counterclaim isn’t a surprise. He has openly proclaimed himself a woman-hater. He had the audacity to tweet: 'Literally everything females say is r******d.' Tate brags about how he treats women. This is a quote from him: 'Slap, slap, grab choke, shut up b*tch, sex.' When they were together, Tate told Ms. Stern 'If you don’t start being good, . . . I will f***ing rape you. Because that’s what you deserve.'\"He also told her 'if you ever f*** with me, I will f***ing kill you. I mean it. I will kill you.' Tate’s delusion is that he’s so important that he’s above the law. He isn’t. His counterclaim is junk and will be dismissed. More importantly, I can’t wait to get him in front of a Los Angeles jury.  He will finally be held accountable for his years of his outrageous and harmful conduct. Although Tate has attempted to scrub his social media, unfortunately for him, we have it all. Tate is nothing more than a big mouthed bully, but this time he picked the wrong person.
